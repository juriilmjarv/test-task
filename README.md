# Currency Exchange

A React and TypeScript currency calculator built with Vite. The UI follows the supplied design, with
an on-screen keypad and conversion history.

## Run the project

Use Node.js 22.23.2 (`nvm use` reads `.nvmrc`), then install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

For a fresh checkout, copy the environment template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

If `.env` already exists, keep it. Set `CANDIDATE_ID` to the email address that received the
assignment and leave it unchanged. `API_URL` is provided in the template. The app needs the live API
to load currencies and request quotes.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite. To serve a production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Tests and checks

Install the Playwright browser once, then run the complete CI suite:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:ci
```

CI runs unit, component, integration, and desktop/mobile browser tests once. API responses are
controlled, so no `.env` or live service is needed for these tests. The browser suite builds and
runs the real app on port **5199**.

The optional live API check uses the same browser journeys on port **5200**:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:live
```

It requires the API environment settings above. HTTP 429/500 responses or service outages can fail
this check; it is excluded from CI. Keep the relevant test port free. Failed browser runs save
screenshots and traces in `test-results/`.

| Command                 | Purpose                                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm test`              | Unit, component, and integration tests in watch mode |
| `npm run test:unit`     | Run those tests once                                 |
| `npm run test:e2e`      | Browser tests with controlled API responses          |
| `npm run test:e2e:live` | Browser tests against the live API                   |
| `npm run test:ci`       | All deterministic tests once                         |
| `npm run typecheck`     | Type-check the app, tests, and configuration         |
| `npm run lint`          | Check ESLint rules and TS/CSS spacing                |
| `npm run format`        | Apply Prettier, ESLint fixes, and CSS spacing        |

Add `-- --headed` to either browser-test command to watch the browser.

## Implementation

- Each component has its own TSX file, CSS Module, and behavior tests. Shared colors and spacing
  live in `src/styles/`.
- Calculator and history state live in `src/state/`; API calls and quote handling live in `src/api/`
  and `src/hooks/`. Tested helpers live in `src/utils/`.
- Every amount or currency change requests a fresh quote. Older responses cannot replace the current
  result. Saving requires a current, unexpired quote.
- History stores unformatted amounts, stays in memory, and resets on reload.
- `decimal.js` handles multiplication and rounding to two decimal places. Long values shrink to fit,
  with scrolling available when needed.
- Vitest and Testing Library cover logic and component interactions. Playwright covers browser
  journeys in desktop and mobile Chromium.

## Original assignment

The original brief is preserved below.

Our accountant Margaret needs to convert currencies every day. A colleague put together a small
"Currency Exchange" app for her in a hurry. It works, mostly. Margaret is not entirely happy with
it, and it certainly doesn't look like the design yet.

### 🙋‍♀️ Your task

- Rebuild the UI to match the
  [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/8BkixtyYPHDdRVNXsv0lI6/Calculator-and-currency-exchange-app?node-id=0-1&t=GKGWbEC9xGVoCvrY-1)
  as closely as possible. The current markup only follows the order of the components on the
  screens.
- Don't feel bound by the existing code. It was written with Sonnet 3.7 and reviewed with GPT-3.5,
  so it is far from perfect. You don't need to preserve any of it; on the contrary, we expect a much
  better implementation that follows the behaviour described below.
- Implement the `test:ci` script in `package.json`. It should run the whole test suite once and exit
  with the correct code so it can be used in a CI/CD pipeline.
- Our users have complained about a few things (see below). Look into them, and into anything else
  you notice along the way.

### 💸 How the app works

The app has two tabs: **Exchange Rate** and **History**. All input comes from the on-screen keypad.

#### Exchange Rate

- Users choose both currencies with native Select elements.
- Users type the amount for the first currency on the keypad. The second currency is calculated from
  a fresh quote on every change of the amount or of either currency.
- The screen shows when the quote was last updated. The reload button requests a fresh quote.

#### History

- Shows the saved conversions and the number of records.
- The app starts with a few records already in the history. History is kept in memory only.

#### Keypad

| Key                | Exchange Rate                               | History                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `0`–`9`, `00`, `.` | Types the amount                            | Disabled                                                                             |
| ⌫                  | Removes the last typed character            | Removes the selected record                                                          |
| `C`                | Resets the amount to `0`                    | Removes all records                                                                  |
| `m`                | Saves the current conversion to the history | Disabled                                                                             |
| ▲ / ▼              | —                                           | Moves the selection up / down                                                        |
| 🆗                 | —                                           | Loads the currencies and amount of the selected record and switches to Exchange Rate |

### 😤 User complaints

- "Sometimes the result shows an amount for the wrong currency."
- "When I pick an old conversion from History, the amount is wrong."

### 👩‍💻 Development

- Using AI tools is allowed.
- Use React. All other libs are up to you.
- If any aspect of the desired UI behaviour is ambiguous, please use your expertise and implement
  the best UX. Feel free to add any third-party libraries you find useful.
- The API is available under `/api` (see `vite.config.ts`). Before you start, set `CANDIDATE_ID` in
  `.env` to the email address we sent the task to (copy `.env.example` to `.env` if it's missing)
  and keep it unchanged for the whole task.
- The app should run via `npm run dev` and build via `npm run build` (`npm run preview` serves the
  build).
- `npm test` runs the tests.

#### Test ids

Whatever markup you end up with, please keep these `data-testid` attributes on the matching
elements. The current code already has them.

| `data-testid`                                                            | Element                                                              |

| `from-currency`, `to-currency`                                           | Currency selects (keep them native `<select>` elements)              |
| `amount`                                                                 | Typed amount                                                         |
| `result`                                                                 | Converted amount                                                     |
| `updated-at`                                                             | When the quote was last updated                                      |

| `key-backspace`, `key-clear`, `key-save`, `key-up`, `key-down`, `key-ok` | `⌫`, `C`, `m`, `▲`, `▼`, 🆗                                          |

### 📦 What we expect back

- Your changes as a branch or a pull request in a separate repository as a link or a zip with repo.
  Once ready, send a link (or attached zip) to email from which you received the task.
- Project should start with npm command.
- A `FINDINGS.md` file. For every problem you found: the symptom, the root cause, and the fix, or
  why you decided not to fix it.

### ⏱️ Time

Please don't spend more than 8 hours. We are interested in how you prioritise, not in a perfect
result.
